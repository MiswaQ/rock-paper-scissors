# Rock Paper Scissors!

Greetings and welcome to my [Rock Paper Scissors](https://miswaq.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) game.
This is a fun game to play if you are interested in playing
a totally random game against a computer.
When we play rock paper scissors with friends and family.
The randomness will actually never be there.
As playing against another person there are different strategies
thoughts and impulses that removes the randomness.
But playing a computer that only follows total randomness.

I can give you an example:
If you would play a friend and you on each try would choose rock.
The opponent would ofc just chose paper and always win.
But against a computer if you would continue to only chose rock
you would actually never know what the computer will choose as it
will always chose random.
<br>
<br>

Try it and hope you enjoy visiting this site and playing this game.
Good luck and have fun!
<br>

<br>

As favicon on the page tab I have chosen to have the scissors hand.<br>
Chose a slitely different one to get some variety.
<br>
<br>

##### Colors chosen for this page are..
![Chosen colors on the page.](/assets/images/readmimg/chosencollor.png)
<br>
I chose this colors so that there is a darker theme in the background while there is a colorful game on top.
<br>
<br>

##### Features I would have wanted to have!
- I would want to set a cap on how many games there is. Preferably the game would be first up to 10 points win.
- Ones one has come up to 10 points the game would ask if user would want to play again.
- I would also want to have a high score where user would if they got good points be able to add name and be placed on the board.
- The reaction time would be another thing. As the user chooses an option the reaction from computer would be delayed half a sec.
- And also the point would be added at the same time as computer choice are shown.
- When loading the page the start button and hands will also have delayed appearance.
<br>
<br>

##### Testing!
###### Human testing:
- Tested that points always show correctly.
- Img always show the correct one.
- I have tested it in Opera Browser, Fire fox and Google Chrome.
- My family have gotten to try it out and give feedback.
<br>

###### Validator testing:
- HTML Validator - https://validator.w3.org/
    - Validation came out with no errors.
<br>

- CSS Validator - https://jigsaw.w3.org/
    - Validation came out with no errors.
<br>

- JS Validator - https://jshint.com/
    - Validator came with error message "'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6')<br>
      or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz)". I looked it up and was told that this is not an issue but that in the future<br>
      I need to learn to update within the settings in gitpod. And in jsHints add the esversion 6.
<br>
