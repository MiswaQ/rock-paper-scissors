# Rock Paper Scissors!

Greetings and welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors game.
This is a fun game to play if you are interested in playing
a totaly random game against a computer.
When we play rock paper scissors with friends and family.
The randomness will actually never be there.
As playing against another person there is different strategies
thoughts and impulses that removes the randomness.
But playing a computer that only follows total randomness.

I can give you an example:
If you would play a friend and you on each try would chose rock.
The apponent would ofc just chose paper and always win.
But against a computer if you would continue to only chose rock
you would actually never know what the computer will chose as it
always will chose random.

Try it and hope you enjoy visiting this site and playing this game.
Good luck and have fun!
